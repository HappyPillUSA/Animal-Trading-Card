			<p>They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground.As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat, and they only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! </p>
